# My webapps

This repository's purpose is to house early-stage applications so that I can
easily experiment and try out new ideas without redoing the same busy work with
each new attempt. Basically, I want to reduce the activation energy for turning
an idea into a reality.

A secondary goal would be to document and possibly templatize this setup so
that it's relatively easy to separate out a facet of this work if I'd like.

## Goals:

- [X] Django on DigitalOean:
- [X] Running in docker container
- [ ] Modern static frontend ie) react
  - We'll need some sort of token-based authentication
- [ ] Good testing infrastructure

### Live server goals:
- [X] Docker running uwsgi
- [ ] Subdomain routing in nginx
- [ ] nginx server
	- nginx & uwsgi
- [ ] Deployable with fab command
- HTTPS Certificate
- DB Backup
